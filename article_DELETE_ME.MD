# Generate SDKs with Goa

This tutorial explains how to define an application programming interface (API) service written in Go with Goa, convert it to an OpenAPI 3 schema with Goa, and convert that to software development kits (SDKs) in multiple languages with Speakeasy.

Below is a graphical summary of the creation process you will follow.

  Speakeasy --> ts[TypeScript SDK]
  Speakeasy --> c[C# SDK]
  Speakeasy --> p[Python SDK]
  Speakeasy --> etc[Other languages...]

```

We will talk you through creating a complete code example. By the end of the tutorial you will have a working API service running in Go that you call through Typescript code in an SDK.

## Prerequisites
You need only Docker, version 20 or greater. You can complete this tutorial on Linux, Mac, or Windows since Docker commands are not dependent on your operating system, or any installed frameworks.

If you are running on Windows, please replace backslashes with forward slashes in the few places where we refer to a folder path on your physical machine.

## Goa

[Goa](https://goa.design/learn/getting-started/) is a package written in the Go language that allows you to define an API in Go syntax using functions from the Goa design language. Goa uses your definition in its `design.go` file to create
- an OpenAPI schema that can be used by programmers, or tools like Speakeasy, to understand your API,
- Go code for a client application to call your API,
- a command line interface (CLI) to call your API,
- the low level transport-agnostic code to provide the API on a server over protocols like HTTP and gRPC,
- Go code stubs for the service itself, that you can complete with business logic.

## Customising the schema
- How can you customize the OpenAPI spec generated by Goa?
- What kind of customizations lead to better SDK generations

- operationId for each path.
- Use $ref instead of inline schemas for input/output.
- Speakeasy-specific OpenAPI extensions, for example, retries.
- Tags to organize code in the generated SDKs.

## Tsoa

## Create the API specification in Goa

```bash
cd ~/code/speakeasy-goa-example;
mkdir app;
docker stop gobox; docker rm gobox;
docker run --name gobox -v ./app:/go/src/app -it golang:1.21.2 bash;
cd src/app;
go mod init app;
go install goa.design/goa/v3/cmd/goa@v3;
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest;
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest;

# download https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v24.4/protoc-24.4-linux-x86_64.zip from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
# unzip and paste bin/protoc exe file into ./app/lib
export PATH=$PATH:/go/src/app/lib # can't use relative path here
```

On subsequent runs, you can start the container instead of rebuilding it:

```bash
docker start gobox; docker exec -it gobox bash;
```

Write the API specification in `app/design/design.go`.

```bash
goa gen app/design;
goa example app/design;
```

In your host machine terminal, not in the container terminal, give yourself permissions to edit the created files. Rerun this whenever you create a file in the container.

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./app;
```

In `order.go` set: `return "A nice cup of tea", nil`

Compile it in the container.
```bash
go get app/cmd/club; # download dependencies
go build ./cmd/club && go build ./cmd/club-cli;
```

Since Go compiles to executables, you can now run the Club server in your physical machine.
```bash
./club
```

In another terminal
```bash
./club-cli --help
./club-cli order tea --body '{"includeMilk": false, "isGreen": false, "numberSugars": 1 }' # A nice cup of tea
 ./club-cli band play --body '{"style": "Bebop" }' # No response
```

## Create the API with Speakeasy

Speakeasy is an online-only service. Please register before continuing this tutorial: https://app.speakeasyapi.dev. Once you've registered, create a workspace named `club`. Browse to API keys. Click `New Api Key`. Name it `club`. Copy and save the key content to use later.

Speakeasy supports these languages: [C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift, Typescript](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/create-client-sdks#language-support).

## Set up the Speakeasy CLI
The CLI is the simplest way to use Speakeasy. This tutorial uses Docker, but if you want to install Speakeasy directly on your computer in the future, follow the instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy#installation).


```bash
docker stop speakbox; docker rm speakbox;
docker run --name speakbox -v ./app:/app -it alpine:3.18.4 sh; # docker run --name speakbox -v ./app:/app -it ubuntu:22.04 bash;
apk add curl unzip sudo; # apt update; apt install curl unzip sudo -y;
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy/main/install.sh | sh;
```

Now Speakeasy installed. Test it by running:

```bash
speakeasy help;
```

Now add you API key that you saved earlier when registering with Speakeasy.
```
export SPEAKEASY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Aside>
If you exit the container and want to return to it later, run:
```bash
docker start speakbox; docker exec -it speakbox sh;
```
</Aside>

## Build an SDK
You now have `app/gen/http/openapi3.yaml` and Speakeasy. So you can build the SDK. In the speakbox container you started in the last section, run:

```bash
speakeasy generate sdk \
    --schema /app/gen/http/openapi3.yaml \
    --lang typescript \
    --out /app/sdk
```

Remember to give yourself permissions to the files on your host machine again.

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./app;
```

validate your schema
